In this project, we have collected images and generated a Dataset for three classes and used YOLOV5 to accemplish multicass detection, specifically identifying whether individuals are wearing a mask correctly, not wearing it or wearing it incorrectly fro√∂ the generated dataset using PyTorch.
The Suggested Model achieved excellent values in detecting the three classes with an accuracy with arround 88%.
